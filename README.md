[00:19.16] (Wish we were back in the past)
[00:21.11] (So we could make this time last)
[00:23.64] (I hope this shit doesn't crash)
[00:25.82] (Hope we're not moving too fast)
[00:41.82] 
[00:28.37] This love's just hurting me bad
[00:30.91] I swear you're driving me mad
[00:33.25] It sucks that shit never last
[00:35.68] I hope we're different from that
[00:38.33] Girl, I'ma keep waiting on you
[00:41.39] I can't stop thinking 'bout you
[00:43.45] I know we're making it through, ahh
[01:00.95] 
[00:47.46] Is it too much to ask for?
[00:50.01] Sometimes I wonder where I'd be if you weren't planned for
[00:54.78] I never ask for much but girl you're all I could ask for
[00:59.47] It sucks to see you dancing all alone on the dancefloor
[01:06.09] It's so much better when we're together
[01:10.82] I never wanted you more than ever
[01:16.10] I tried to help
[01:18.42] I cried it out
[01:20.89] And I just can't imagine you with someone else
[01:43.89] 
[01:24.96] This love's just hurting me bad
[01:27.22] I swear you're driving me mad
[01:29.63] It sucks that shit never last
[01:31.95] I hope we're different from that
[01:34.60] Girl, I'ma keep waiting on you
[01:37.71] I can't stop thinking 'bout you
[01:39.64] I know we're making it through, ahh
